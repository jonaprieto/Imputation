# Dealing with Missing Data using a Selection Hybrid Algorithm

* This is the repository to expose a *hybrid* algorithm for missing values imputation
in categorical data. We propose a new algorithm, called \textit{RINS algorithm},
to address the imputation problem of missing values on categorical databases
using the framework of Rough Set Theory. This algorithm combines the approach
of a generalized nonsymmetric similarity relation with a generalized discernibility
matrix in order to predict the missing values on incomplete information systems.
The computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm is effective and
competitive as other imputation algorithms.
