ARSI Algorithm [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/65102386.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/65102386)
==============

We deal with the so-called missing data problem, which is the problem
of imputing missing values in information systems. We propose a new
algorithm, called ARSI algorithm, to address the imputation problem
of missing values on categorical databases using the framework of
Rough Set Theory. This algorithm can be seen as a refinement of ROUSTIDA
algorithm and combines the approach of a generalized nonsymmetric
similarity relation with a generalized discernibility matrix to predict
the missing values on incomplete information systems.
Computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm is as efficient
and competitive as other imputation algorithms.
